# Zero-Knowledge-Groth16
Author: Javier Antxon Garrues Apecechea

This is the code repository for my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Bachelor's in Computer Science dissertation. 

You can find the full document on my LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/aiandmaths.

There are two notebooks in this repository:
  - interpolation.ipynb
  - groth16.ipynb

-> interpolation.ipynb: code to obtain the polynomials representing the example problem we present in the dissertation.

-> groth16.ipynb: code to obtain the elliptic curve cryptographic tools and mimic the Groth16 protocol step-by-step.


**Note: there will only be a few commits in this repository because version control was done using cloud services and jupyter.
